# PScheduler-Rewrite

Under Development, a rewrite of [PScheduler](https://github.com/PhillipNgo/pScheduler). Refactoring front end to be in React/Redux and also moving schedule creation logic to the front-end to put load off of the server.

Creating an database of courses rather than a IO with a text-file. Going serverless in production with AWS Lambdas as the API and using a Spring Boot API locally so there won't be a need to run the lambdas.
